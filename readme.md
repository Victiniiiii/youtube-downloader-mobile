# youtube-downloader-mobile

This is an Android app that can download audio and video from various sites.  
You will need to re-install the app when yt-dlp deprecates (downloads give error 403), since i can't pip update the package inside sandbox environment.

## Download
ATTENTION: If you want to save your downloads anywhere except the regular sdcard/Download folder, you will need to give the app Files and Media permissions. Go to Settings --> Apps --> "Youtube Downloader" --> Permissions --> Here, allow files and media permissions.
